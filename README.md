## Description

Dynamic time warping (DTW) is an algorithm used to measure similarity between different data series, which may vary in speed.

## Setup

### Makefile
Setup via Makefile:
- Clone the repository first.

- Help and overview of commands:
    ```bash
    make help
    ```

- Setup (Create the venv, install libraries and pull minimal data setup):
    ```bash
    make setup
    ```

- Activate Python venv:
    ```bash
    make venv
    ```

- Clean project:
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

### Python venv (Poetry)

- Poetry is used for the virtual Python environment.
  - Install [python poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry):
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    pip install --user poetry
    ```

  - Make sure that the virtual environment is installed in the root folder of this projects:
    ```bash
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
    ```

  - Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry install --no-root
    ```

  - Add packages:
    To add further packages, run:
    ```bash
    poetry add <package-name>
    ```

### Code formatting
- Formatting via pre-commit hook:
  Python code is formatted using pre-commit hooks.
- Install pre-commit:
  ```bash
  pip install pre-commit
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  brew install pre-commit
  ```

- Install pre-commit hooks from the config file .pre-commit-config.yaml
  ```bash
  pre-commit install
  ```

- Run the pre-commit hooks:
  ```bash
  pre-commit run -a
  ```

### Code testing
Testing is done with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/). The pytest package is already installed in the poetry venv.
- Run all tests:

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

- Run individual tests:

  ```bash
  pytest <path-to-test-files>
  ```

## Usage
- Example files in `/examples/`
